# Libft
> Why using standard libraries, if you can have your own :-P

Of course using the common C libraries such as ```string.h```, ```stdlib.h```, ```unistd.h```, etc. would be faster. But as a first step in the core curriculum of 42 was to built our own library with a lot of famous functions. The goal is to get familiar with the functions to be able to use them instinctivly in the future.



Includes all projects, that are allowed in the library (e.g. libft, get_next_line, printf)

This library is used in other projects of the 42 Core Curriculum
